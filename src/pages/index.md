## Quick start

In this version of WhatsAPI, rather than providing the source code. Which is often difficult to manage, we provide you with a single executable binary. This binary is a self-contained executable that can be run on any system. It is also very easy to manage and update. Also having everyting on your server ensures data security and privacy. This guide assumes you are using a Linux system. If you are using Windows, you can use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to run the WhatsAPI binary.

### Getting your system ready

It's always preferable to keep system updated before installing any software. So, first update your system using the following command.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

The installation part is covered in the [Installation](/docs/installation) page. You can follow the instructions there to install WhatsAPI on your system.
